<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
If the NCAA can have March Madness, then the American Dahlia Society can have
a "Dahlia Duke-Out".  This is a contest run strictly for fun to decide a
"People's Choice" winner from the 32 top entries in the 2022 New Introductions
list.  Starting March 1, two entries from the list will be pitted against each
other.  You, the people, will vote on which one you like.  The winners of the
first round will then be pitted against each other, until we run through the
Elite Eight, the Final Four, and the Championship round on March 31.

The winner will be presented with a prestigious but meaningless "People's
Choice" trophy.

<p>
Voting runs from 6 AM until 2 AM.  We are not restricting you to one vote
per person, but use discretion.  Remember, nothing is at stake here.

<h3>Regions</h3>
<p>
The four regions essentially map to the four quadrants of the
Portland area, NW, SW, NE, and SE.  To view the list of "teams"
and their seeds, click these:

</ul>

<h3>Methodology</h3>
<p>
If you're curious abouthow we set this up, here is a summary.
<p>
We started with the 85 entries in the Americal Dalia Society's 2022 New 
Introductions list.  It turns out 85 is not a convenient number for a
bracket scheme, without having some "wild card" games.  In addition, we
didn't want this nonsense to last more than a month.  If you have N teams in
a single-elimination tournament, you need to have N-1 games to decide a winner.
That meant 64 was too many (two months), so we settled on 32.
<p>
So, we sorted the ADS new introductions list by their Trial Garden Score. 
We took the top 32 entries, and those are the "teams" in our tournament.
To make it a little like March Madness, we divided the set up into four
"regions".  The top four entries by score became the number 1 seeds in 
the four regions.  The next four entries by score became the number 2 seeds,
and so on.
<p>
The NCAA uses a very specific scheme to decide the first matchups.  They
want to make sure to give the top seeds as much chance as possible, so they
don't pit number 1 againsst number 2 right away.  Instead, their first 
round matches the number 1 seed with the number 8 seed,  number 2 plays 
number 7, number 3 plays number 6, and number 4 plays number 5.  We have
adopted the same system here.
