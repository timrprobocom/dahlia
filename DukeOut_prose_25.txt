Irish Trophy
    This purple and THIS lavender -- ogether!  What more can you ask?  It
    dreamed of being a peony form, woke up and said, “No! I’ve changed my

    Sandy Boley, Irish Trophy already lives up to its potential.

    Count ’em.  Ten petals.  Extra beauty for a darling lavender collarette

    ever-so-pleasing three notches down in lavender, but that eye zone!!
    Check it out.  It’s as DARK as can be and still be called purple.
    OK---call it black if you like.  That dark velvety background convinces
    all that lavender to pop.
