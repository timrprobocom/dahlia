You're receiving this message because you participated in last year's "Dahlia Duke-Out", our light-hearted attempt to have a March Madness competition in the world of dahlias.

I wanted to let you know that we are just about ready to begin "Dahlia Duke-Out 2024".  We've extract the top 32 scorers from the American Dahlia Society's "New Introductions" list and pitted them against each other, just like last year.  You have the opportunity to vote on each pairing, once per day, as the pairings move into the Sweet Sixteen, the Elite Eight, the Final Four, and the big championship.

You will need to register a username for yourself.  There's no password, since there's no private information to protect.  To avoid confusion, I've erased all of the usernames from last year, so you can make up a new one.  If you go to the home page at http://timr.4roberts.us/dahlia/ , you'll see a link about half-way down allowing you to register your username.

The competition will begin Monday, April 1, and will last throughout the month of April.  The web site will send a reminder every day to all registered users.  At the end, I'll send out a wrap-up message identifying the winning dahlia strain, and the names of those who picked the most winners along the way.

Good luck!
